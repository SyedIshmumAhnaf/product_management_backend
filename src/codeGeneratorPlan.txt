Plan to generate the function code:

1. Starting with the longest increasing substring:
- convert name to lowercase, run a loop and compare letters with a pre-defined max
- if current letter is greater than pre-defined max then join letter to a primary string
- if not, then add to the formed primary string to a list for final comparison later
- use a loop to find maxLength of all the words in the list
- run another loop to find and concatenate words having maxLength from the list

2. Finding and adding the starting and ending indices:
